# Weather App 

# Purpose
An app I created as an exercise to test my knowledge of Node.js.

# Description
This app makes use of the [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and [Dark Sky](https://darksky.net/forecast/40.7127,-74.0059/us12/en) APIs to deliver the latest, up-to-date weather forecast based on the location entered.

# Status
## Done
* Integration of Mapbox API (geocoding)
* Integration of Dark Sky API (weather)

## In Progress
* Web Server using Handlebars and Express
    - Using partials and views to create dynamic web pages to host the app
